Based on the given job description and given skillset of a candidate. 
Give me output as the skillsets required for the job based on the description inlcuding keywords as required.
Consider following TypeScript Interface for JSON schema:
```
interface Skill {
  name: string;
  skills: string;
}

interface RESUME_DATA_SCHEMA {
  skills: Skill[];
}

Desired Output: Write the Well-formatted JSON adhering to the RESUME_DATA_SCHEMA schema, handling missing values with empty strings or "None".
<JSON_OUTPUT_ACCORDING_TO_RESUME_DATA_SCHEMA>

The results should contain valid JSON only, without any delimiter or characters making invalid JSON format.
